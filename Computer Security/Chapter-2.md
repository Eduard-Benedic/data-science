## Symmetric Encryption

Data Encryption Standard - DES
Advanced Encryption Standard - AES

Both are block encryption algorithms

Symmetric encryption - aka conventional encryption or single-key encryption

A single-key encryptions has 5 parts:
1. Plaintext
2. Encryption algorithm - performs various substitutions and transformations on plaintext
3. Secret key - is also input to the encryption algorithm. The exact substitution and transformations peformed by the algorithm depend on the key.
4. Ciphertext - the scrambled message produces as the output
5. Decryption algorithm - the encryption algorithm run in reverse. It takes the ciphertext and the secret key and produces the original plaintext.
