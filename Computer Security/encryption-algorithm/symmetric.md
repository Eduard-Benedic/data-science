# Week 1

Multiple Block Encription 

* ECB - Electronic codebook
* CBC - Cipher Block Chaining
* OFM - Output Feedback Mode
* CFB - Cipher Feedback Block

Cryptographic systems are described based on 3 factors:
* Type of operations
  * Substitution
  * Transposition

* Number of keys
  * symmetric (sender and receiver have the same key)
  * assymetric (2 key or public key encryption)

* How the plaintext is processed
  * block cipher (processes one block of elements at a time)
  * stream cipher (process 1 element at a time)

Cryptanalysis - the process of attempting to find the plaintext or key
